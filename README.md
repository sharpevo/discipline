Discipline is just an attempt to implement some ideas on note management. I have tried lots of softwares to get my notes organized, Listpro, Phatnotes, Daynotez, Evernote, Wikidpad, Zim, Tobu, Piggydb etc. Unfortunately, none of them support mindless input, and represent logical, flexible, linear/map views. Some of the features are:
* Markdown.
* Sqlite backend.
* Manipulated without a mouse.
* Phatnotes import.
* Quick filter.

Now I am trying Zim + Encfs + Dropbox, along with the theory of concept-map, to fix the architecture rather than what Discipline does.
